Based since 1973 at the School of Public Health of the Universit{\'{e}} Catholique de Louvain, Belgium, CRED became in 1980 a World Health Organization (WHO) collaboration centre. Since then, CRED has worked closely with United Nations agencies, inter-governmental and governmental institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutes and other universities. Disasters preparedness, mitigation and prevention for vulnerable populations have also gained a higher profile within CRED's activities in recent years. www.cred.be EM-DAT CRED's Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) contains the world's most comprehensive data on the occurrence and effects of more than 21,000 technological and natural disasters from 1900 to the present day. Created with the support of the WHO and the Belgian government, the main objective of EM-DAT is to inform humanitarian action at the national and international levels in order to improve decision-making in disaster preparedness, provide objective data for assessing communities' vulnerability to disasters and to help policy-makers set priorities. In 1999, a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development's Office Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) and CRED was initiated. Since 2014, EM-DAT also georeferences natural disasters, adding geographical values to numeric data which is essential for deeper analysis. Details of EM-DAT's methodology and partner organizations can be found on our website www.emdat.be},

	abstract = {The Yogyakarta area in Indonesia suffered a devastating earthquake on 27 May 2006. There was an immediate international response, and the International Charter "Space and Major Disasters" was activated, leading to a rapid production of image-based damage maps and other assistance. Most of the acquired images were processed by UNOSAT and DLR-ZKI, while substantial damage mapping also occurred on the ground. This paper assesses the accuracy and completeness of the damage maps produced based on Charter data, using ground damage information collected during an extensive survey by Yogyakarta's Gadjah Mada University in the weeks following the earthquake and that has recently become available. More than 54,000 buildings or their remains were surveyed, resulting in an exceptional validation database. The UNOSAT damage maps outlining clusters of severe damage are very accurate, while earlier, more detailed results underestimated damage and missed larger areas. Damage maps produced by DLR-ZKI, using a damage-grid approach, were found to underestimate the extent and severity of the devastation. Both mapping results also suffer from limited image coverage and extensive cloud contamination. The ground mapping gives a more accurate picture of the extent of the damage, but also illustrates the challenge of mapping a vast area. The paper concludes with a discussion on ways to improve Charter-based damage maps by integration of local knowledge, and to create a wider impact through generation of customised mapping products using web map services. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Fast and reliable identification of collapsed buildings is essential in case of earthquake disasters in urban areas. Airborne laserscanning offers the possibility to fulfil this task. Based on height measurements, geometrical surface models of buildings can be generated with this technology. Comparing the undamaged pre-event models with those recorded after an earthquake, the location of collapsed buildings and the dimension and characteristic of their damage can be obtained. The knowledge about typical damage types of collapsed buildings is necessary to interpret the changes found between the pre- and post-event building models. As existing building damage classifications don't meet the requirements of this novel technique, observations and reports of building collapses were analysed. This leads to a new classification system of collapsed buildings and the definition of the so-called “damage catalogue”.The damage catalogue is a composition of different damage types of entire buildings typically occurring after earthquakes and it contains the observed dimensions of the geometrical features such as volume reduction or inclination change for each damage type. Besides the detectability of these geometrical features in airborne laserscanning data, the differentiation of the damage types takes effects on casualty numbers and on different search and rescue needs into account. The damage catalogue was developed by evaluating the associated database, which contains the characterisation of real damaged buildings by the defined geometrical features.The paper includes the conception of the damage catalogue and of the associated database, their use for the described reconnaissance technique and their further application possibilities.},

On September 6, 2017, it first made landfall in Antigua and Barbuda as a Hurricane of category 5 and continued its path though several Caribbean Islands until September 10, 2017 when it hit the southwest of the United States of America. IRMA-17 severely affected several Caribbean Islands with storm surges, intense rainfall and strong winds that reached 298 km/h. According to UNOCHA, 48 people have been reported dead, 1.2 million people have been affected by damage to water infrastructure and 17,000 people are in immediate need of shelter. The Caribbean disaster emergency management agency (CDEMA) in the last Hurricane IRMA-Situation Reports ({\#}7, {\#}8 and {\#}9) are still listing the ongoing priority needs, including food and medicine, in several islands such as Anguilla, Virgin Islands (UK), or Turks and Caicos among others. On 05 September 2017, UNITAR-UNOSAT on behalf of UN OCHA activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters to support the planning and coordination of emergency response operations with satellite imagery analysis covering most affected areas in the Caribbean region. Within the operational framework of this Charter Call, UNITAR-UNOSAT and SERTIT have supported emergency response operations by providing satellite-derived value-added analysis {\&} mapping products covering the following countries and territories: Antigua {\&} Barbuda, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos, Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin. In addition, due to the magnitude and widespread of damages caused by the powerful hurricane IRMA-17, satellite imagery analysis support was also provided by other agencies and satellite mapping groups such as COPERNICUS EMS and NGA who covered with satellite analysis as many affected countries / territories as possible. UNITAR-UNOSAT provided overall satellite analysis coordination support for this event by regularly updating the GDACS Satellite Mapping and Coordination System platform (SMCS). An access link to the GDACS-SMCS platform was shared with all end-users to provide them with updated information about satellite acquisition and analysis plans including expected product delivery by different agencies or satellite mapping groups. In addition, due to the magnitude and widespread damage caused by the powerful hurricane IRMA-17, other agencies and satellite mapping groups such as COPERNICUS EMS and NGA also provided satellite imagery analysis support in order to analyze as many affected countries / territories as possible.

The development of new algorithms in the field of Computer Vision drastically improved the degree of automation of the 3D point clouds generation using the photogrammetry techniques. In addition, data acquisition techniques using the UAV allow a complete 3D model with the highest possible resolution especially with respect to the conventional satellite or aerial photogrammetry to be produced. These advantages make the UAV photogrammetry highly suitable for surveys in a geo-hazard context as in a post-earthquake scenario.

In this paper, an improved technique, Earthquake Damage Visualization (EDV) is presented for the rapid detection of earthquake damage using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The EDV is based on the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherence change method. The normalized difference between the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherences, and vice versa, are used to calculate the forward (from pre-seismic to co-seismic) and backward (from co-seismic to pre-seismic) change parameters, respectively. The backward change parameter is added to visualize the retrospective changes caused by factors other than the earthquake. The third change-free parameter uses the average values of the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherence maps. These three change parameters were ultimately merged into the EDV as an RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) composite imagery. The EDV could visualize the earthquake damage efficiently using Horizontal transmit and Horizontal receive (HH), and Horizontal transmit and Vertical receive (HV) polarizations data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2). Its performance was evaluated in the Kathmandu Valley, which was hit severely by the 2015 Nepal Earthquake. The cross-validation results showed that the EDV is more sensitive to the damaged buildings than the existing method. The EDV could be used for building damage detection in other earthquakes as well.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTPost-disaster damage assessment is urgent for rapid save and rescue missions. Satellite and airborne imagery platforms take vertical images, in which only buildings? roofs are observable. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an alternative platform that can obtain oblique images from a scene but suffer from occlusion (hiding from view) and a smaller field of view. As imagery from each platform has several pros and cons, a fusion framework is required. A new framework is proposed in this article, based on building environment and image processing techniques to utilize the advantages of different platforms while avoiding the disadvantages. In this approach, a facade is detected in UAV oblique images by fusing a geometrical transformation and environmental information from vertical and oblique images. Fusion of roof and facade features is used to improve damage scale estimation. Damage is estimated automatically for both roof-only and facade-plus-roof images that are sourced from satellite and fused data respectively. The proposed approach is applied to several different datasets including the Haiti earthquake of 2010, Hurricane Irene of 2011, Hurricane Sandy of 2012 and the Illinois tornadoes of 2015. The proposed automatic fusion framework led to enhanced damage scale estimation in comparison with the roof-only damage assessment in these cases.},

	abstract = {Oblique aerial images offer views of both building roofs and fa??ades, and thus have been recognized as a potential source to detect severe building damages caused by destructive disaster events such as earthquakes. Therefore, they represent an important source of information for first responders or other stakeholders involved in the post-disaster response process. Several automated methods based on supervised learning have already been demonstrated for damage detection using oblique airborne images. However, they often do not generalize well when data from new unseen sites need to be processed, hampering their practical use. Reasons for this limitation include image and scene characteristics, though the most prominent one relates to the image features being used for training the classifier. Recently features based on deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to be more effective than conventional hand-crafted features, and have become the state-of-the-art in many domains, including remote sensing. Moreover, often oblique images are captured with high block overlap, facilitating the generation of dense 3D point clouds - an ideal source to derive geometric characteristics. We hypothesized that the use of CNN features, either independently or in combination with 3D point cloud features, would yield improved performance in damage detection. To this end we used CNN and 3D features, both independently and in combination, using images from manned and unmanned aerial platforms over several geographic locations that vary significantly in terms of image and scene characteristics. A multiple-kernel-learning framework, an effective way for integrating features from different modalities, was used for combining the two sets of features for classification. The results are encouraging: while CNN features produced an average classification accuracy of about 91{\%}, the integration of 3D point cloud features led to an additional improvement of about 3{\%} (i.e. an average classification accuracy of 94{\%}). The significance of 3D point cloud features becomes more evident in the model transferability scenario (i.e., training and testing samples from different sites that vary slightly in the aforementioned characteristics), where the integration of CNN and 3D point cloud features significantly improved the model transferability accuracy up to a maximum of 7{\%} compared with the accuracy achieved by CNN features alone. Overall, an average accuracy of 85{\%} was achieved for the model transferability scenario across all experiments. Our main conclusion is that such an approach qualifies for practical use.},

	abstract = {The effects of earthquake can be devastating, it may cause significant life losses and property damage especially in urban regions. Observation of damaged buildings is vital for emergency management professionals, helping them for directing the rescue teams in short time to right location. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Technologies (GIS) are an efficient tool for rapid monitoring of damaged buildings in urban regions following an earthquake. An approach was developed to determine automatic detection of damaged buildings through analysis of change with the aid of integrated RS and Information Technologies in the case of Van Erciş earthquake, which occurred on 23 October 2011. In this study pre and post event, Normalized Digital Surface Models (nDSM) were generated by subtracting the pre and post event Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) for the years 2010 and 2011. The image differences between pre and post event DEM and DSM provide the pre and post event database for building patches. A change analysis was then applied to nDSM in order to detect damaged buildings. The performance of the analysis was evaluated by an accuracy assessment method using reference ground truth raster data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is encouraging for automatic detection of damaged buildings and it is a time saving method for monitoring buildings after earthquake.},

	abstract = {16 Over the past 15 years, scientists and disaster responders have increasingly used satellite-based Earth observations for global rapid assessment of disaster situations. We review global trends in satellite rapid response and emergency mapping from 2000 to 2014, analyzing more than 1000 incidents in which satellite monitoring was used for assessing major disaster situations. We provide a synthesis of spatial patterns and temporal trends in global satellite emergency mapping efforts and show that satellite-based emergency mapping is most intensively deployed in Asia and Europe and follows well the geographic, physical, and temporal distributions of global natural disasters. We present an outlook on the future use of Earth observation technology for disaster response and mitigation by putting past and current developments into context and perspective. D isaster responders and the humanitarian community increasingly use Earth Obser-vation (EO) satellite systems to assess the impact of and to plan and coordinate emer-gency response activities after major natural disasters around the world. EO systems provide response and relief workers with tools to lift the " fog off disaster. " EO satellites help overcome op-erational uncertainties after major disasters that impede emergency response because of limited, incomplete, and often contradictory ground infor-mation. Furthermore, EO satellites provide emer-gency responders with a situational overview otherwise difficult to obtain during an ongoing disaster event. For example, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can see through storm clouds to remotely assess in near real time the exact extent or severity of flood disasters as they unfold. Local, national, and international agencies also use satellite-based emergency mapping (SEM) as part of larger resilience strategies (1) to help design, implement, and evaluate disaster risk reduction and recovery programs (2–4). The ultimate goal of SEM is to improve disaster relief effectiveness and thus to help reduce suffering and fatalities before, during, and after a disaster event occurs. We focus our Review on the response phase im-mediately after a disaster, which typically lasts from several days to a few weeks. This phase is technically challenging because of the strict time constraints and demands special skill sets and coordination among disaster responders, the SEM community, satellite operators, and international organizations.

The area, amount, rate, and type of the damage are essential information for rescue, humanitarian and reconstruction operations in the disaster area. Remote sensing techniques play an important role in obtaining building damage information because of their non-contact, low cost, wide field of view, and fast response capacities. Now that more and diverse types of remote sensing data become available, various methods are designed and reported for building damage assessment. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in two categories: multi-temporal techniques that evaluate the changes between the pre- and post-event data and mono-temporal techniques that interpret only the post-event data. Both categories of methods are discussed and evaluated in detail in terms of the type of remote sensing data utilized, including optical, LiDAR and SAR data. Performances of the methods and future efforts are drawn from this extensive evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Quick post-disaster actions demand automated, rapid and detailed building damage assessment. Among the available technologies, post-event oblique airborne images have already shown their potential for this task. However, existing methods usually compensate the lack of pre-event information with aprioristic assumptions of building shapes and textures that can lead to uncertainties and misdetections. However, oblique images have been already captured over many cities of the world, and the exploitation of pre- and post-event data as inputs to damage assessment is readily feasible in urban areas. In this paper, we investigate the potential of multi-temporal oblique imagery for detailed damage assessment focusing on two methodologies: the first method aims at detecting severe structural damages related to geometrical deformation by combining the complementary information provided by photogrammetric point clouds and oblique images. The developed method detected 87{\%} of damaged elements. The failed detections are due to varying noise levels within the point cloud which hindered the recognition of some structural elements. We observed, in general that the fa{\c{c}}ade regions are very noisy in point clouds. To address this, we propose our second method which aims to detect damages to building fa{\c{c}}ades using the oriented oblique images. The results show that the proposed methodology can effectively differentiate among the three proposed categories: collapsed/highly damaged, lower levels of damage and undamaged buildings, using a computationally light-weight approach. We describe the implementations of the above mentioned methods in detail and present the promising results achieved using multi-temporal oblique imagery over the city of L'Aquila (Italy).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the proposed method, a simple and efficient visual attention method is first used to extract built-up area candidates (BACs) from each multispectral (MS) satellite image. After this, morphological building indices (MBIs) are extracted from all the masked panchromatic (PAN) and MS images with BACs to characterize the structural features of buildings. Finally, buildings are automatically detected in a hierarchical probabilistic model by fusing the MBI and masked PAN images. The experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable to supervised classification methods in terms of recall, precision and F-value.},

	abstract = {Post-disaster very high resolution (VHR) satellite data are potential sources to provide detailed information on damage and geological changes for a large area in a short time. In this paper, we studied landslides triggered by the Mw 6.9 earthquake in Sikkim, India which occurred on 18 September 2011 using VHR data from Cartosat-1, GeoEye-1, QuickBird-2 and WorldView-2 satellites. Since the earthquake-affected area is located in mostly inaccessible Himalayan terrain, VHR data from these satellites provided a unique opportunity for quick and synoptic assessment of the damage. Using visual change analysis technique through comparison of pre- and post-earthquake images, we assessed the damage caused by the event. A total of 123 images acquired from eight satellites, covering an area of 4105 km2 were analysed and 1196 new landslides triggered by the earthquake were mapped. Road blockages and severely affected villages were also identified. Geological assessment of the terrain highlighted linear disposition of landslides along existing fault scarps, suggesting a reactivation of fault. The landslide inventory map prepared from VHR images also showed a good correlation with the earthquake shake map. Results showed that several parts of north Sikkim, particularly Mangan and Chungthang, which are close to the epicentre, were severely affected by the earthquake, and that the event-based landslide inventory map can be used in future earthquake-triggered landslide susceptibility assessment studies.},

The Italian Space Agency's COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite acquired data over Kathmandu area four days after the earthquake and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 SAR satellite for larger area nine days after the mainshock. We used these radar observations and rapidly produced damage proxy maps (DPMs) derived from temporal changes in Interferometric SAR coherence. Our DPMs were qualitatively validated through comparison with independent damage analyses by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research's United Nations Operational Satellite Applications Programme, and based on our own visual inspection of DigitalGlobe's WorldView optical pre- versus postevent imagery. Our maps were quickly released to responding agencies and the public, and used for damage assessment, determining inspection/imaging priorities, and reconnaissance fieldwork.},

	abstract = {Disasters have adversely affected humans since the dawn of our existence. In response, individuals and societies alike have made many attempts to decrease their exposure to the consequences of these disasters. All of these efforts have the same goal: disaster management. The motivating concepts that guide disaster management—the reduction of harm to life, property, and the environment—are largely the same throughout the world. Whether due to political, cultural, economic, or other reasons, the unfortunate reality is that some countries and some regions are more capable than others at addressing the problem. Furthermore, the emergence of a global economy makes it increasingly difficult to contain the consequences of any disaster within one country's borders. This chapter examines basic concepts of disaster management and expands upon those concepts to specifically address the management of international disasters, which is a complex discipline. Like disaster management on the national level, it involves actions that seek to mitigate the effects of hazards, ensures that populations are prepared for disasters should they occur, facilitates the response to disasters that do occur, and helps nations and people recover in the months and years following disaster events. The chapter provides a brief history of disaster management. To illustrate the disparity in the effects of disasters around the world, an examination of the global impact of disasters has also been carried out.},

@book{Hanssen2001,
	abstract = {This book is the product of five and a half years of research dedicated to the und- standing of radar interferometry, a relatively new space-geodetic technique for m- suring the earth's topography and its deformation. The main reason for undertaking this work, early 1995, was the fact that this technique proved to be extremely useful for wide-scale, fine-resolution deformation measurements. Especially the interf- ometric products from the ERS-1 satellite provided beautiful first results—several interferometric images appeared as highlights on the cover of journals such as Nature and Science. Accuracies of a few millimeters in the radar line of sight were claimed in semi-continuous image data acquired globally, irrespective of cloud cover or solar illumination. Unfortunately, because of the relative lack of supportive observations at these resolutions and accuracies, validation of the precision and reliability of the results remained an issue of concern. From a geodetic point of view, several survey techniques are commonly available to measure a specific geophysical phenomenon. To make an optimal choice between these techniques it is important to have a uniform and quantitative approach for describing the errors and how these errors propagate to the estimated parameters. In this context, the research described in this book was initiated. It describes issues involved with different types of errors, induced by the sensor, the data processing, satellite positioning accuracy, atmospheric propagation, and scattering character- tics. Nevertheless, as the first item in the subtitle “Data Interpretation and Error Analysis” suggests, data interpretation is not always straightforward.},

	abstract = {State of the art reviews of remote sensing change detection are becoming increasingly complicated and disparate due to an ever growing list of techniques, algorithms and methods. To provide a clearer, synoptic view of the field this review has organised the literature by the unit of analysis and the comparison method used to identify change. This significantly reduces the conceptual overlap present in previous reviews giving a succinct nomenclature with which to understand and apply change detection workflows. Under this framework, several decades of research have been summarised to provide an overview of current change detection approaches. Seven units of analysis and six comparison methods were identified and described highlighting the advantages and limitations of each within a change detection workflow. Of these, the pixel and post-classification change methods remain the most popular choices. In this review we extend previous summaries and provide an accessible description of the field. This supports future research by placing a clear separation between the analysis unit and the change classification method. This separation is then discussed, providing guidance for applied change detection research and future benchmarking experiments.},

	abstract = {We present a hybrid neural-network for human face recognition which compares favourably with other methods. The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer.},

	abstract = {The $\kappa$ coefficient is a popular descriptive statistic for summarizing an agreement table. It is sometimes desirable to combine some of the categories, for example, when categories are easily confused, and then calculate $\kappa$ for the collapsed table. Since the categories of an agreement table are nominal and the order in which the categories of a table are listed is irrelevant, combining categories of an agreement table is identical to partitioning the categories in subsets.In this paper we prove that given a partition type of the categories, the overall $\kappa$-value of the original table is a weighted average of the $\kappa$-values of the collapsed tables corresponding to all partitions of that type. The weights are the denominators of the kappas of the subtables. An immediate consequence is that Cohen's $\kappa$ can be interpreted as a weighted average of the $\kappa$-values of the agreement tables corresponding to all non-trivial partitions.The $\kappa$-value of the 2×2 table that is obtained by combining all categories other than the one of current interest into a single "all others" category, reflects the reliability of the individual category. Since the overall $\kappa$-value is a weighted average of these 2×2 $\kappa$-values the category reliability indicates how a category contributes to the overall $\kappa$-value. It would be good practice to report both the overall $\kappa$-value and the category reliabilities of an agreement table. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The coefficient of association of Forbes indicates the amount of association be- tween two given species compared to the amount of association between them expected by chance. In order to provide a simple direct measure of the amount of association of one species with another the association index is proposed. If a is the number of random samples of a given series in which species A occurs and h is the number of samples in which another species B occurs together with A, then the association index B/A = h/a. Similarly, if b is the number of samples in which species B occurs, then the associa- tion index A/B = h/b. There is also proposed a coincidence index, 2h/(a + b), whose value is intermediate between the two reciprocal association indices. As a measure of the statistical reliability of the deviation shown by the samples of a given series from the amount of associa- tion expected by chance, the chi-square test may be used.},

	abstract = {It has been past more than 15 years since the F-measure was first introduced to evaluation tasks of information extraction technology at the Fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4) in 1992. Recently, sometimes I see some confusion with the definition of the F- measure, which seems to be triggered by lack of background knowledge about how the F-measure was derived. Since I was not involved in the process of the introduction or device of the F-measure, I might not be the best person to explain this but I hope this note would be a little help for those who are wondering what the F-measure really is. This introduction is devoted to provide brief but sufficient information on the F-measure.},

@article{Buckland1994,
	abstract = {Empirical studies of retrieval performance have shown a tendency for Precision to decline as Recall increases. This article examines the nature of the relationship between Precision and Recall. The relationships between Recall and the number of documents retrieved, between Precision and the number of documents retrieved, and between Precision and Recall are described in the context of different assumptions about retrieval performance. It is demonstrated that a tradeoff between Recall and Precision is unavoidable whenever retrieval performance is consistently better than retrieval at random. More generally, for the Precision–Recall trade-off to be avoided as the total number of documents retrieved increases, retrieval performance must be equal to or better than overall retrieval performance up to that point. Examination of the mathematical relationship between Precision and Recall shows that a quadratic Recall curve can resemble empirical Recall–Precision behavior if transformed into a tangent parabola. With very large databases and/or systems with limited retrieval capabilities there can be advantages to retrieval in two stages: Initial retrieval emphasizing high Recall, followed by more detailed searching of the initially retrieved set, can be used to improve both Recall and Precision simultaneously. Even so, a tradeoff between Precision and Recall remains. {\textcopyright} 1994 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc. TS - RIS},

In one paradox, a high value of P0can be drastically lowered by a substantial imbalance in the table's marginal totals either vertically or horizontally. In the second pardox, $\kappa$ will be higher with an asymmetrical rather than symmetrical imbalance in marginal totals, and with imperfect rather than perfect symmetry in the imbalance. An adjustment that substitutes Kmaxfor $\kappa$ does not repair either problem, and seems to make the second one worse. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

	abstract = {The family of Kappa indices of agreement claim to compare a map's observed classification accuracy relative to the expected accuracy of baseline maps that can have two types of randomness: (1) random distribution of the quantity of each cat- egory and (2) random spatial allocation of the categories. Use of theKappa indices has become part of the culture in remote sensing and other fields. This article exam- ines five different Kappa indices, some of which were derived by the first author in 2000. We expose the indices' properties mathematically and illustrate their limi- tations graphically, with emphasis on Kappa's use of randomness as a baseline, and the often-ignored conversion from an observed samplematrix to the estimated populationmatrix. This article concludes that theseKappa indices are useless,mis- leading and/or flawed for the practical applications in remote sensing that we have seen. After more than a decade of working with these indices, we recommend that the profession abandon the use of Kappa indices for purposes of accuracy assess- ment and map comparison, and instead summarize the cross-tabulation matrix with two much simpler summary parameters: quantity disagreement and alloca- tion disagreement. This article shows how to compute these two parameters using examples taken from peer-reviewed literature.},

In concordance with the variety of investigations, the building damage descriptions are really incoherent because a well-coordinated damage scale has not been prepared yet. This paper proposed a new chart for describing the building damage patterns by seismic vulnerability so as to help investigators to classify building damaged without a gross error. Furthermore, various damage scales defined by the organizations concerned can be compared with each other by using this chart as a common scale. Moreover, we proposed new damage vulnerability functions of various kinds of structure, the functions which can depict the relation between ground motion severity and damage degree of building.},

This research identifies how decision-makers from humanitarian agencies and the Philippine Government ‘make sense' of this model and its predictions in order to prioritise municipalities for humanitarian assistance. This research explores what the Priority Index Model is, what similar initiatives are, who the decision-makers are that have to prioritise and what their information needs are. To answer the main question of this research, interviews are conducted with decision-makers from humanitarian agencies and the Philippine government at local, regional and national levels. As identified, appropriate, reliable and timely information is necessary and remains unclear in the literature what these concepts mean for decision-makers. This research explores those concepts and defines whether the Priority Index Model contributes to an more cost- effective and efficient way of prioritising. This is seen in the light of a trend in the Philippines: the establishments of Common Operational and Fundamental Operational Datasets that contribute to the Common Operational Picture.},
