abstract = {The effects of earthquake can be devastating, it may cause significant life losses and property damage especially in urban regions. Observation of damaged buildings is vital for emergency management professionals, helping them for directing the rescue teams in short time to right location. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Technologies (GIS) are an efficient tool for rapid monitoring of damaged buildings in urban regions following an earthquake. An approach was developed to determine automatic detection of damaged buildings through analysis of change with the aid of integrated RS and Information Technologies in the case of Van Erciş earthquake, which occurred on 23 October 2011. In this study pre and post event, Normalized Digital Surface Models (nDSM) were generated by subtracting the pre and post event Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) for the years 2010 and 2011. The image differences between pre and post event DEM and DSM provide the pre and post event database for building patches. A change analysis was then applied to nDSM in order to detect damaged buildings. The performance of the analysis was evaluated by an accuracy assessment method using reference ground truth raster data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is encouraging for automatic detection of damaged buildings and it is a time saving method for monitoring buildings after earthquake.},

abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is remarkable for its capability to record the backscattering coefficient, the physical value of the earth's surface, regardless of weather condition or sun illumination. Therefore, SAR is a powerful tool that can be utilized to develop a universal method to comprehend damaged areas in disasters such as earthquakes, forest fires, and floods. We performed a feasibility study on backscattering characteristics of damaged areas in the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe), Japan, earthquake using the pre- and post-event ERS images, revealing that the backscattering coefficient and intensity correlation between the two attained values were significantly lowered in hard-hit areas. The evaluation, however, was performed without speckle noise reduction. We also investigated the effects of speckle noise reduction and pixel-window size in evaluating building damage using the difference in the backscattering coefficient and correlation coefficient of the pre- and post-event ERS images. From the analysis, an optimum window size for the damage evaluation was obtained. It was also found that the accuracy of damage detection is not significantly improved for speckle-reduction filtering of window size larger than 21X21 pixels. We developed an automated method to detect hard-hit areas based on the discriminant analysis, and compared the detected distribution with a damage survey result.},

abstract = {Post-disaster very high resolution (VHR) satellite data are potential sources to provide detailed information on damage and geological changes for a large area in a short time. In this paper, we studied landslides triggered by the Mw 6.9 earthquake in Sikkim, India which occurred on 18 September 2011 using VHR data from Cartosat-1, GeoEye-1, QuickBird-2 and WorldView-2 satellites. Since the earthquake-affected area is located in mostly inaccessible Himalayan terrain, VHR data from these satellites provided a unique opportunity for quick and synoptic assessment of the damage. Using visual change analysis technique through comparison of pre- and post-earthquake images, we assessed the damage caused by the event. A total of 123 images acquired from eight satellites, covering an area of 4105 km2 were analysed and 1196 new landslides triggered by the earthquake were mapped. Road blockages and severely affected villages were also identified. Geological assessment of the terrain highlighted linear disposition of landslides along existing fault scarps, suggesting a reactivation of fault. The landslide inventory map prepared from VHR images also showed a good correlation with the earthquake shake map. Results showed that several parts of north Sikkim, particularly Mangan and Chungthang, which are close to the epicentre, were severely affected by the earthquake, and that the event-based landslide inventory map can be used in future earthquake-triggered landslide susceptibility assessment studies.},

abstract = {The Yogyakarta area in Indonesia suffered a devastating earthquake on 27 May 2006. There was an immediate international response, and the International Charter "Space and Major Disasters" was activated, leading to a rapid production of image-based damage maps and other assistance. Most of the acquired images were processed by UNOSAT and DLR-ZKI, while substantial damage mapping also occurred on the ground. This paper assesses the accuracy and completeness of the damage maps produced based on Charter data, using ground damage information collected during an extensive survey by Yogyakarta's Gadjah Mada University in the weeks following the earthquake and that has recently become available. More than 54,000 buildings or their remains were surveyed, resulting in an exceptional validation database. The UNOSAT damage maps outlining clusters of severe damage are very accurate, while earlier, more detailed results underestimated damage and missed larger areas. Damage maps produced by DLR-ZKI, using a damage-grid approach, were found to underestimate the extent and severity of the devastation. Both mapping results also suffer from limited image coverage and extensive cloud contamination. The ground mapping gives a more accurate picture of the extent of the damage, but also illustrates the challenge of mapping a vast area. The paper concludes with a discussion on ways to improve Charter-based damage maps by integration of local knowledge, and to create a wider impact through generation of customised mapping products using web map services. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Earthquakes are among the most catastrophic natural disasters to affect mankind. One of the critical problems after an earthquake is building damage assessment. The area, amount, rate, and type of the damage are essential information for rescue, humanitarian and reconstruction operations in the disaster area. Remote sensing techniques play an important role in obtaining building damage information because of their non-contact, low cost, wide field of view, and fast response capacities. Now that more and diverse types of remote sensing data become available, various methods are designed and reported for building damage assessment. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in two categories: multi-temporal techniques that evaluate the changes between the pre- and post-event data and mono-temporal techniques that interpret only the post-event data. Both categories of methods are discussed and evaluated in detail in terms of the type of remote sensing data utilized, including optical, LiDAR and SAR data. Performances of the methods and future efforts are drawn from this extensive evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTPost-disaster damage assessment is urgent for rapid save and rescue missions. Satellite and airborne imagery platforms take vertical images, in which only buildings? roofs are observable. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an alternative platform that can obtain oblique images from a scene but suffer from occlusion (hiding from view) and a smaller field of view. As imagery from each platform has several pros and cons, a fusion framework is required. A new framework is proposed in this article, based on building environment and image processing techniques to utilize the advantages of different platforms while avoiding the disadvantages. In this approach, a facade is detected in UAV oblique images by fusing a geometrical transformation and environmental information from vertical and oblique images. Fusion of roof and facade features is used to improve damage scale estimation. Damage is estimated automatically for both roof-only and facade-plus-roof images that are sourced from satellite and fused data respectively. The proposed approach is applied to several different datasets including the Haiti earthquake of 2010, Hurricane Irene of 2011, Hurricane Sandy of 2012 and the Illinois tornadoes of 2015. The proposed automatic fusion framework led to enhanced damage scale estimation in comparison with the roof-only damage assessment in these cases.},

abstract = {This report investigates techniques for detecting fine scale scene changes using repeat pass Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. As SAR is a coherent imaging system two forms of change detection may be considered, namely incoherent and coherent change detection. Incoherent change detec- tion identifies changes in the mean backscatter power of a scene typically via an average intensity ratio change statistic. Coherent change detection on the other hand, identifies changes in both the amplitude and phase of the trans- duced imagery using the sample coherence change statistic. Coherent change detection thus has the potential to detect very subtle scene changes to the sub-resolution cell scattering structure that may be undetectable using inco- herent techniques. The repeat pass SAR imagery however, must be acquired and processed interferometrically. This report examines the processing steps required to form a coherent image pair and describes an interferometric spot- light SAR processor for processing repeat pass collections acquired with DSTO Ingara X-band SAR. The detection performance of the commonly used average intensity ratio and sample coherence change statistics are provided as well as the performance of a recently proposed log likelihood change statistic. The three change statistics are applied to experimental repeat pass SAR data to demonstrate the relative performance of the change statistics.},

abstract = {Automated damage assessment based on satellite imagery is crucial for initiating fast response actions. Several methods based on supervised learning approaches have been reported as effective for automated mapping of damages using remote sensing images. However, adopting these methods for practical use is still challenging, as they typically demand large amounts of training samples to build a supervised classifier, which are usually not readily available. With the advancement in technologies local and detailed damage assessment for individual buildings is being made available, for example through analysis of images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles, monitoring systems installed in buildings, and through crowdsourcing. Often such assessments are being done in parallel, with results becoming available progressively. In this paper, an online classification strategy is adopted where a classifier is built incrementally using the streaming damage labels from various sources as training samples, i.e. without retraining it from the scratch when new samples stream in. The Passive-Aggressive online classifier is used for the classification process. Apart from the classifier, the choice of image features plays a crucial role in the performance of the classification. The features extracted using recently reported deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which learns features directly from images, have been reported to be more effective than conventional handcrafted features such as gray level co-occurrence matrix and Gabor wavelets. Thus in this study, the potential of CNN features is explored for online classification of satellite image to detect structural damage, and is compared against handcrafted features. The feature extraction and classification process is carried out at an object level, where the objects are obtained by over-segmentation of the satellite image. The proposed online framework for damage classification achieves a maximum overall accuracy of about 73{\%}, which is comparable to that of batch classifier accuracy (74{\%}) obtained for the same training and testing samples, however at a significantly lesser time and memory requirements. Moreover, the CNN features always significantly outperform handcrafted features.},

abstract = {Abstract: The multitude of satellite data products available offers a large choice for urban studies. Urban space is known for its high heterogeneity in structure, shape and materials. To approach this heterogeneity, finding the optimal spatial resolution (OSR) is needed for urban form detection from remote sensing imagery. By applying the local variance method to our datasets (pan-sharpened images), we can identify OSR at two levels of observation: individual urban elements and urban districts in two agglomerations in West Europe (Strasbourg, France) and in Southeast Asia (Da Nang, Vietnam). The OSR corresponds to the minimal variance of largest number of spectral bands. We carry out three categories of interval values of spatial resolutions for identifying OSR: from 0.8 m to 3 m for isolated objects, from 6 m to 8 m for vegetation area and equal or higher than 20 m for urban district. At the urban district level, according to spatial patterns, form, size and material of elements, we propose the range of OSR between 30 m and 40 m for detecting administrative districts, new residential districts and residential discontinuous districts. The detection of industrial districts refers to a coarser OSR from 50 m to 60 m. The residential continuous dense districts effectively need a finer OSR of between 20 m and 30 m for their optimal identification. We also use fractal dimensions to identify the threshold of homogeneity/heterogeneity of urban structure at urban district level. It seems therefore that our approaches are robust and transferable to different urban contexts.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Quick post-disaster actions demand automated, rapid and detailed building damage assessment. Among the available technologies, post-event oblique airborne images have already shown their potential for this task. However, existing methods usually compensate the lack of pre-event information with aprioristic assumptions of building shapes and textures that can lead to uncertainties and misdetections. However, oblique images have been already captured over many cities of the world, and the exploitation of pre- and post-event data as inputs to damage assessment is readily feasible in urban areas. In this paper, we investigate the potential of multi-temporal oblique imagery for detailed damage assessment focusing on two methodologies: the first method aims at detecting severe structural damages related to geometrical deformation by combining the complementary information provided by photogrammetric point clouds and oblique images. The developed method detected 87{\%} of damaged elements. The failed detections are due to varying noise levels within the point cloud which hindered the recognition of some structural elements. We observed, in general that the fa{\c{c}}ade regions are very noisy in point clouds. To address this, we propose our second method which aims to detect damages to building fa{\c{c}}ades using the oriented oblique images. The results show that the proposed methodology can effectively differentiate among the three proposed categories: collapsed/highly damaged, lower levels of damage and undamaged buildings, using a computationally light-weight approach. We describe the implementations of the above mentioned methods in detail and present the promising results achieved using multi-temporal oblique imagery over the city of L'Aquila (Italy).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The damage of buildings and manmade structures, where most of human activities occur, is the major cause of casualties of from earthquakes. In this paper, an improved technique, Earthquake Damage Visualization (EDV) is presented for the rapid detection of earthquake damage using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The EDV is based on the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherence change method. The normalized difference between the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherences, and vice versa, are used to calculate the forward (from pre-seismic to co-seismic) and backward (from co-seismic to pre-seismic) change parameters, respectively. The backward change parameter is added to visualize the retrospective changes caused by factors other than the earthquake. The third change-free parameter uses the average values of the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherence maps. These three change parameters were ultimately merged into the EDV as an RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) composite imagery. The EDV could visualize the earthquake damage efficiently using Horizontal transmit and Horizontal receive (HH), and Horizontal transmit and Vertical receive (HV) polarizations data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2). Its performance was evaluated in the Kathmandu Valley, which was hit severely by the 2015 Nepal Earthquake. The cross-validation results showed that the EDV is more sensitive to the damaged buildings than the existing method. The EDV could be used for building damage detection in other earthquakes as well.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a general methodology for post-tsunami damage assessment and an automatic procedure able to distinguish between different kinds of damage on built-up structures using very-high-resolution satellite data. The procedure for automatic detection of damaged built-up structures was designed using a multi-criteria approach fusing radiometric, textural, and morphological image features related to pre- and post-disaster data detection. The proposed procedure shows good performance with an estimated overall accuracy equal to 93.97{\%}. The best performances are estimated in the discrimination between non-flooded and flooded built-up structures and in the recognition of collapsed built-up structures with debris in place. Problems of omission error were detected in the recognition of collapsed built-up structures without debris in place as in the case of completed erased built-up structures situated close to the shoreline.},

abstract = {Fast crisis response after natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tropical storms, is necessary to support, for instance, rescue, humanitarian, and reconstruction operations in the crisis area. Therefore, rapid damage mapping after a disaster is crucial, i.e., to detect the affected area, including grade and type of damage. Thereby, satellite remote sensing plays a key role due to its fast response, wide field of view, and low cost. With the increasing availability of remote sensing data, numerous methods have been developed for damage assessment. This article gives a comprehensive review of these techniques focusing on multi-temporal SAR procedures for rapid damage assessment: interferometric coherence and intensity correlation. The review is divided into six parts: First, methods based on coherence; second, the ones using intensity correlation; and third, techniques using both methodologies combined to increase the accuracy of the damage assessment are reviewed. Next, studies using additional data (e.g., GIS and optical imagery) to support the damage assessment and increase its accuracy are reported. Moreover, selected studies on post-event SAR damage assessment techniques and examples of other applications of the interferometric coherence are presented. Then, the preconditions for a successful worldwide application of multi-temporal SAR methods for damage assessment and the limitations of current SAR satellite missions are reported. Finally, an outlook to the Sentinel-1 SAR mission shows possible solutions of these limitations, enabling a worldwide applicability of the presented damage assessment methods.},

@article{Vetrivel2016b,
abstract = {Oblique aerial images offer views of both building roofs and fa??ades, and thus have been recognized as a potential source to detect severe building damages caused by destructive disaster events such as earthquakes. Therefore, they represent an important source of information for first responders or other stakeholders involved in the post-disaster response process. Several automated methods based on supervised learning have already been demonstrated for damage detection using oblique airborne images. However, they often do not generalize well when data from new unseen sites need to be processed, hampering their practical use. Reasons for this limitation include image and scene characteristics, though the most prominent one relates to the image features being used for training the classifier. Recently features based on deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to be more effective than conventional hand-crafted features, and have become the state-of-the-art in many domains, including remote sensing. Moreover, often oblique images are captured with high block overlap, facilitating the generation of dense 3D point clouds - an ideal source to derive geometric characteristics. We hypothesized that the use of CNN features, either independently or in combination with 3D point cloud features, would yield improved performance in damage detection. To this end we used CNN and 3D features, both independently and in combination, using images from manned and unmanned aerial platforms over several geographic locations that vary significantly in terms of image and scene characteristics. A multiple-kernel-learning framework, an effective way for integrating features from different modalities, was used for combining the two sets of features for classification. The results are encouraging: while CNN features produced an average classification accuracy of about 91{\%}, the integration of 3D point cloud features led to an additional improvement of about 3{\%} (i.e. an average classification accuracy of 94{\%}). The significance of 3D point cloud features becomes more evident in the model transferability scenario (i.e., training and testing samples from different sites that vary slightly in the aforementioned characteristics), where the integration of CNN and 3D point cloud features significantly improved the model transferability accuracy up to a maximum of 7{\%} compared with the accuracy achieved by CNN features alone. Overall, an average accuracy of 85{\%} was achieved for the model transferability scenario across all experiments. Our main conclusion is that such an approach qualifies for practical use.},

As UAVs can be considered as a lowcost alternative to the classical manned aerial photogrammetry, new applications in the short- and close-range domain are introduced. Rotary or fixed wing UAVs, capable of performing the photogrammetric data acquisition with amateur or SLR digital cameras, can fly in manual, semiautomated and autonomous modes. Following a typical photogrammetric workflow, 3D results like Digital Surface or Terrain Models (DTM/DSM), contours, textured 3D models, vector information, etc. can be produced, even on large areas. The paper reports the state of the art of UAV for Geomatics applications, giving an overview of different UAV platforms, applications and case studies, showing also the latest developments of UAV image processing.

abstract = {The main advantage of using the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry in a post-earthquake scenario is the ability to completely document the state of the structures and infrastructures, damaged by the earthquake, ensuring the safety of all operators during the data acquisition activities. The safety and accessibility aspect in the area is of crucial concern after an earthquake and sometimes many areas may be inaccessible, but, at the same time, it is necessary to collect data in order to monitor and evaluate the damage. The development of new algorithms in the field of Computer Vision drastically improved the degree of automation of the 3D point clouds generation using the photogrammetry techniques. In addition, data acquisition techniques using the UAV allow a complete 3D model with the highest possible resolution especially with respect to the conventional satellite or aerial photogrammetry to be produced. These advantages make the UAV photogrammetry highly suitable for surveys in a geo-hazard context as in a post-earthquake scenario. Some results from surveys carried out with the UAV photogrammetry after L'Aquila Earthquake occurred in 2009 will be presented and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group},
